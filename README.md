# Week1-InClass-Task1-Distance-Finder

Suppose we have a rectangle [0,a] x [0,b]

Question: If we generate two points, z1 and z2, randomly in the rectangle, 
what is the expected distance, d, between them?

You can find pseudocode for this problem in the file DistanceFinderPseudocode.R in this directory.

Download (clone) that file, work on it, and then upload (commit and push) your working code.
